## Project Description
This team project was implemented during the course of Image Processing at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. It's purpose is the study and implementation of the efficient
stereo matching algorithm described in the paper: https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2005.56, using three different cost functions for the pixelwise matching cost. For a comprehensive
